Hi there!

This project aims to evaluate MRI data extracted from the Kaggle dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri/data. MRI scans in this file is divided into 4 types: glioma_tumor, meningioma_tumor, no_tumor, and pituitary_tumor. Gliomas, arising from glial cells, often display irregular borders and signal intensity. Meningiomas, arising from the meninges, typically present with well-defined borders, contrast, and a 'tail'. Pituitary tumors, arising from the pituitary gland, can often display varying signal intensities and at times, compression of adjacent structures. I aim to train a model using Tensorflow/Keras to be able to identify these different tumors.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, thank you!
